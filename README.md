TO YOUR GIST THAT CONTAINS YOUR WEBPAGE,

NOT A LINK TO THE PREVIEW OR CS HOMEPAGE. WE WON‚ÄôT BE ABLE TO GRADE YOUR SUBMISSION OTHERWISE.

1. Create a Basic Webpage

1. Create a Github account at https://github.com/join (https://github.com/join) and login. Tip: You can get the student pack when using your UW email, which will give you unlimited free private repositories.

2. Go to https://gist.github.com/ (https://gist.github.com/)

You will be creating a GitHub Gist for your homepage. GitHub Gists are small, special kinds if GitHub repositories that make editing your code and other files through a web interface, and sharing those project with other on the web easy. You can use GitHub‚Äôs online interface to work on your webpage online, or your favorite git client to clone it to a local repository and push back your local changes to GitHub.

3. Name the new file home_page.html and type in the following HTML:

4. Click on Create secret gist button, as shown below

5. To view your web page from the internet (with your web browser)

(https://gist.github.com/%3cgithub-Id%3e/a6b778e81623b0e2eb92bb0f8afead71) The number in the link above highlighted in bold is the gist-id. Note it down, you will

2. To view your website, we are going to use the gist preview tool

(https://gistpreview.github.io/ (https://gistpreview.github.io/) ), that renders websites from GitHub GISTs.

UPDATE 08/03: gistpreview does not support external files well (it will have trouble displaying images in the HTML and css and javascript in external files won‚Äôt work).

An alternative is the platform blocks: http://bl.ocks.org (http://bl.ocks.org) . You can create a preview of your webpage by creating the link: http://bl.ocks.org/[git username]/[gist id]. Replace [git username] with your username and [gist id] with the id of your gist (the number highlighted above).

1. a header with the course number, CS400

2. a footer with your hometown or favorite or least favorite town

3. a list of favorites or least favorite things

4. an image (png or jpg)

2. After completing the above, add the following to your project:

2. a link to another page (either one you create or another on the internet)

3. After completing the above

1. add a button named ‚ÄúCHANGE‚Äù that the user can click.

2. Add some JavaScript to the button so that the button label changes with each click of the button. The JavaScript can be inline in the html, or in an externally linked file.
